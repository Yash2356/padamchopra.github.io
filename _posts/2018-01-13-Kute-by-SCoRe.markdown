description: Kute is the commute app for Sri Lanka built by SCoRe Lab, being Open Source it is available for free and thus an actual option to consider.<br><br><b>What is Kute?</b><br> Kute is a commute managing app which allows you to seamlessly manage your options for both private and public transport. People travel to the same destination on a regular basis for various reasons using public and private transport. When you use Kute, you're known as a user/traveller and are allowed to share your location so that the co-travellers can see a real-time location of the vehicle <i>(Sweet, right?)</i>.  It even shows the user/traveller the expected time at which the transport will arive at the nearest station, so that the user knows how efficiently he needs to work in order to make it to his/her ride on time. <br><br><b>Why is it better than any other alternatives?</b><br> Imagine, Kute is specifically built for Sri Lanka, which means even if it has less man-hours devoted towards building it, it is (by a large margin) going to be the best option for commuters in Sri Lanka. Moreover, since its Open Source, you can download its code from its <a href="https://github.com/scorelab/Kute" target="blank">github repository</a> and follow the installation instructions to build the App. What this means, is that its free and super-customisable!<br><br> Moreover, the easy User Interface provide an unmatched user experience. Take a look at the screenshots and decide for yourself :) <br><br><img src="img/portfolio/kute/6.gif" height="370"> <img src="img/portfolio/kute/1.png" height="370"> <img src="img/portfolio/kute/2.png" height="370"><br><br><img src="img/portfolio/kute/3.png" height="370"> <img src="img/portfolio/kute/4.png" height="370"> <img src="img/portfolio/kute/5.png" height="370"><br><br><b>Status of Kute as on 2018-01-13</b><br>Kute is currently implemented for trains. A registered user can update the current location of a train when travelling by sharing the current location. Another user can view location of a selected train and the expected time a particular train arrives at the nearest station using the location data updated by another user.<br><br><b>My Own Contributions <3</b><br> Being an Open Source fan and a GCI Participant, I've contributed to the Kute app myself as well and that is why I can assure you of its productivity and usage and how practically well thought of it is to be used in daily life. I've contributed the following things to the Kute app [some of them haven't been accepted yet, but I hope they will soon be :) ]<ul style="text-align:left;"><li>Create a logo for it</li><li>Design and Develop a splash screen for the app</li><li>Improve the SignIn UI</li><li>Fix building bugs</li><li>Update the Readme</li></ul><br><br><b>If you're a developer and are interested in contributing to Kute, check it out on <a href="https://github.com/scorelab/Kute" target="blank">Github</a></b>
